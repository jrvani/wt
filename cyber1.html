<h1 style="color:black;font-size:35px;text-align:center"><u><strong>WHAT IS CYBER SECURITY??? EVER WONDERED..</strong></u></h1>
<img src="What-is-Cyber-Security.jpg" class="c"></img>
<p class="pp">
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.

Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly challenging today because there are more devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative.
</br></br>
<div class="about"><strong><u>IMPORTANCE OF CYBER SECURITY</u></strong><br><br>
<strong>CYBER SECURITY</strong> is important because government, military, corporate, financial, and medical organizations collect, process, and store unprecedented amounts of data on computers and other devices. <br><br>
A significant portion of that data can be sensitive information, whether that be intellectual property, financial data, personal information, or other types of data for which unauthorized access or exposure could have negative consequences.<br><br>
Organizations transmit sensitive data across networks and to other devices in the course of doing businesses, and cyber security describes the discipline dedicated to protecting that information and the systems used to process or store it. As the volume and sophistication of cyber attacks grow, companies and organizations, especially those that are tasked with safeguarding information relating to national security, health, or financial records, need to take steps to protect their sensitive business and personnel information. <br><br>
As early as March 2013, the nation’s top intelligence officials cautioned that cyber attacks and digital spying are the top threat to national security, eclipsing even terrorism.

<h1 style="text-align:center;"><u><strong>TYPES OF CYBER THREATS</strong></u></h1>


<p class="pp">Just as pollution was a side effect of the Industrial Revolution, so are the many security vulnerabilities that come with increased internet connectivity. Cyber attacks are exploitations of those vulnerabilities.
For the most part unavoidable, individuals and businesses have found ways to counter cyber attacks using a variety of security measures and just good ol’ common sense. Regardless how safe a business feels it and its systems are, however, everyone must still be aware of and vigilant toward online threats.

<div class="about">
<h2>The threats countered by cyber-security are three-fold:</h2>

<p class="pp">

</br>1. <strong>Cybercrime</strong> includes single actors or groups targeting systems for financial gain or to cause disruption.

</br>2. <strong>Cyber-attack</strong> often involves politically motivated information gathering.

</br>3. <strong>Cyberterrorism</strong> is intended to undermine electronic systems to cause panic or fear.

</br>So, how do malicious actors gain control of computer systems? Here are some common methods used to threaten cyber-security:

<u><ul class="l">Malware</ul></u><br>
<p class="pp">
Malware means malicious software. One of the most common cyber threats, malware is software that a cybercriminal or hacker has created to disrupt or damage a legitimate user’s computer. Often spread via an unsolicited email attachment or legitimate-looking download, malware may be used by cybercriminals to make money or in politically motivated cyber-attacks.
</p>
</br><strong><u><ul class="l">Phishing</strong></ul></u>
<p class="pp">
Phishing is when cybercriminals target victims with emails that appear to be from a legitimate company asking for sensitive information. Phishing attacks are often used to dupe people into handing over credit card data and other personal information.
</p>
</br><strong><u><ul class="l">Man-in-the-middle attack</ul></u></strong>
<p class="pp">
A man-in-the-middle attack is a type of cyber threat where a cybercriminal intercepts communication between two individuals in order to steal data. For example, on an unsecure WiFi network, an attacker could intercept data being passed from the victim’s device and the network.
</p>
</br><strong><u><ul class="l">Denial-of-service attack</ul></u></strong>
<p class="pp">
A denial-of-service attack is where cybercriminals prevent a computer system from fulfilling legitimate requests by overwhelming the networks and servers with traffic. This renders the system unusable, preventing an organization from carrying out vital functions.

<h1><u><ul class="l">Cyber safety tips - protect yourself against cyberattacks</ul></u></h1>
<p class="pp">
 How can businesses and individuals guard against cyber threats? Here are our top cyber safety tips:
<ul class="l">1.<strong>Update your software and operating system:</strong> This means you benefit from the latest security patches.

</br>2.<strong>Use anti-virus software:</strong> Security solutions like Kaspersky Total Security will detect and removes threats. Keep your software updated for the best level of protection.

</br>3.<strong>Use strong passwords:</strong> Ensure your passwords are not easily guessable.

</br>4.<strong>Do not open email attachments from unknown senders:</strong> These could be infected with malware.

</br>5.<strong>Do not click on links in emails from unknown senders or unfamiliar websites:</strong>This is a common way that malware is spread.

</br>6.<strong>Avoid using unsecure WiFi networks in public places:</strong> Unsecure networks leave you vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
